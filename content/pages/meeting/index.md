Timekeepers MC holds meetings every second Wednesday of the month, at 7:30 PM PST. Members normally show up starting at 7:00 PM PST for general conversation. There is always pizza and beer, so make sure to come hungry!

Our meetings are held at Mountain Mike's Pizza in Campbell off of E. Hamilton Ave.
